Filtering API Prototype for JaCoCo
==================================

This is a prototype for a future filtering API for JaCoCo. The API focuses on
filtering and is currently not compatible with JaCoCo. In particular it does not
use any JaCoCo internals like the flow analyzer or probes.

See [wiki](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/wiki/FilteringOptions) for filter
descriptions.
